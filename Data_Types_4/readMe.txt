1.  In Java, there are two types of Data Type : Primitive & Non-Primitive.

2.  There are four basic type of Primitive category data types. They are : Integer, Float, Character & Boolena.

3.  Sub types of Integer : byte (1 byte), short(2 bytes), int(4 bytes), long(8 bytes).

4.  Sub types of Float : double(8 bytes), float(4 bytes).

5.  Sub types of Character : ch(2 bytes).

6.  Sub types of Boolean : true, false.

7.  To declare a float variable " f " needs to be used. Example : float var = 5.6f;

8.  For declaring double no need to mention anything.

.  For declaring a long variable " l " needs to be used. Example : long num = 5854l; 

.  To declare a character type variable, SINGLE QUOTE ('') has to be used. Example : char c = 'k';
